# BrightLog

BrightLog is a FullStack web system which using: React , Express,  Node-Js & Mongo DB.
BrightLog idea came to my head after working in the Solar Power Plant as an operator, and noticed several processes can improve in terms
of Speed, Reliablity & User experience. 

Her purpose is to gather all the operator needs in one place , and help the operator in the Solar Power Plant daily routine challenges:
•	Efficient and convenience daily routine documentation.
•	Easy to function and intuitive checklist options.
•	Automated TXT File writing, promise organized and uniform day summary file in the end of each operation.
•	Message board that will solve the problem of lost information while operators's shift swaps.
